The Golden Grid is a CSS based grid system.

There are two CSS systems called golden-base(golden.css) and golden-extend(reset.css,  golden.css , typography.css)

Golden Base = min css reset + grid system

Golden Extend = complete css reset + grid system + typography

There are *three* things to know about CSS system:

 # g160 means you have 150px columns and 10px left margin.
 # ml240 margin left 250px. If we have ml240 g160 = (margin left 240px + margin left 10px + 150px column) = (margin left 250px + 150px column). This is just a little naming trick.
 # If you need nested div you can use class .inside in the first nested div

That's it!

P.S Use .clear or .clearfix for clearing
